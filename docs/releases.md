# Release Notes

## v2.4.0

> **Release Date**: 2026-03-01
> **Focus**: SQL Language Support + Cross-OS CLI E2E Coverage + Sync Security Hardening

### 🚀 Features

- Added `sql` as a first-class supported language for CLI and TUI flows.
- `leetcode config -l sql` and `leetcode pick ... -l sql` are now supported.
- SQL solution files are generated and recognized with `.sql` extension.

### ⚙️ Improvements

- Centralized language normalization and slug resolution logic in a shared utility.
- Added SQL dialect resolution fallback (`mysql` default) for test/submit compatibility.
- Updated config and help surfaces to display SQL as a supported language.
- Replaced shell-interpolated command strings in `sync` with argument-vector execution for dynamic values.
- Updated `git commit -m`, `git remote add origin`, and `gh repo create` dynamic flows to safer `execFileSync(command, args)` usage.

### 🔒 Security

- Resolves CodeQL alert `js/incomplete-sanitization` by removing custom shell-escaping dependence for user/config-derived arguments.

### 🧪 Testing

- Added dedicated SQL language unit tests for mapping, extension detection, and slug resolution.
- Added deterministic cross-OS CLI E2E command-flow tests (config/workspace/snapshot/help) running in Linux/macOS/Windows CI matrix.

## v2.3.0

> **Release Date**: 2026-02-11
> **Focus**: TUI Functionality + Stability + Cross-Platform Fixes

### ✅ Compatibility

This is a **minor, non-breaking** release.

- Existing CLI command signatures are unchanged.
- Existing problem action shortcuts remain available in TUI (`p/t/s/h/H/V/b/n/e`).

### 🚀 Highlights

#### TUI Functionality (`leetcode`)

- Running `leetcode` (no args, interactive terminal) launches full-screen TUI mode.
- Problem screen uses a **single-column statement layout** with a **unified bottom drawer** for hints, submissions, snapshots, notes, diff, and status/test/submit output.
- Added focus toggle (`Tab`) between statement body and drawer, with `j/k` and arrows scrolling the focused region.
- Action shortcuts are available in problem view: `p/t/s/h/H/V/b/n/e`.
- Close behavior is consistent: `Esc` closes drawer first, then navigates back.
- Rendering and terminal handling include full-screen redraw and cleanup guards (ANSI reset, cursor/raw-mode restoration) to reduce residue/flicker issues.

#### Cross-Platform Sync Fixes

- Fixed `sync` repository-name extraction on Windows by using `path.basename()` instead of Unix-style path splitting.
- Updated shell argument escaping to use double quotes for better cross-platform behavior.

### 🧪 Quality

- Added dedicated TUI tests for problem-screen drawer routing and state transitions.
- Verified with `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build`.

#### Solution Snapshots (`leetcode snapshot`)

Save, restore, and compare different versions of your solutions. Supports save/list/restore/diff/delete operations with auto-backup on restore.

#### Solution Diff (`leetcode diff`)

Compare your current solution with past submissions or files. Shows both solutions with line numbers, or use `--unified` for line-by-line diff.

#### Visual Debugging (`leetcode test --visualize`)

ASCII visualization for test outputs based on problem tags.

- Supports: Array, Linked List, Tree, Binary Tree, Graph, Matrix, String, Stack, Queue, Heap
- Highlights mismatches in red
- Auto-detects 2D arrays as matrices

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

- **Workspace-aware storage**: Config, timer, collab, and snapshots are now isolated per-workspace

### 🧪 Testing Improvements

- Comprehensive test suite with 194 tests
- Integration tests for CLI binary verification
- Multi-workspace isolation tests
- Visual debugging unit tests

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
